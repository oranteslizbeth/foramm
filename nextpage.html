                i wanted to express this in a way where i can show you how much you mean to me. 
                i know you don't want to hear from me, but i just wanted to give you this one last thing to show that i really do care for you and i always will. 
                you're the only one who has access to this website, since i made it password protected and i would appreciate if you could go through it, start to finish. 
                (you dont have to though ofc, but i would like it if you did (i had to learn the basics of a different language and it took a really long time))

                i never really knew how to express myself well in words, 
                so i thought maybe doing this would help you understand just how much i mean it.  
                from the first day we met, i knew you were special.
                i know the odds weren't in our favor at the time, but it felt right whenever i was with you.
                `,
                `
                every moment with you was special to me, and even though things didn’t work out the way we hoped, 
                i will always treasure the time we spent together. 
                you truly made everyday feel special, even if we weren't doing much 
                and i am really sorry i never expressed in a better way.    
                i remember all the little things, the late-night talks, the way you'd smile when something made you happy, 
                the way we could just sit in silence and it would still feel comforting. 
                i don’t know if this means anything to you now, but to me, those were some of the happiest moments of my life.
                you really deserved the best version of me and i really don't know why i didn't give it to you.
                i really hope this isn't the end of our story, i really want to grow and show you that i can be the 
                partner you want to be with if our paths ever cross again.
                i hope this shows you even a fraction of how important you are to me.
                i love you and i always will.
                i enjoyed every second and i wish i could've been better because that's what you deserve.
